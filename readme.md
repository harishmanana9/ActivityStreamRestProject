## Activity Stream Assignment

### Assignment Step Description

In this case study Activity Stream, we will implement Java Persistence API (JPA) for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects/classes and a relational database. 
In this step, we will create this application in two parts one for REST and other for Backend.

- REST will have all the controller classes been implemented
- Backend will have all the configuration classes, model classes, repository classes, service classes and logging aspect been implemented.

### Steps to be followed:

    Step 1: Clone the boilerplate in a specific folder on your local machine and import the same in your eclipse STS.
    Step 2: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for Backend and run the test cases
    Step 3: Go thru the readme.md file and implement the code for REST and run the test cases

### Project structure

The folders and files you see in this repositories, is how it is expected to be in projects, which are submitted for automated evaluation by Hobbes

    Project
	|
	├── step-5-backend-boilerplate              // This project holds all the backend configuration, services, models, loggers
	├── step5-rest-boilerplate                  // This project holds all the REST Controllers
	├── .classpath			                    // This file is generated automatically while creating the project in eclipse
	├── .gitignore			                    // This file contains a list of file name that are supposed to be ignored by git 
	├── .hobbes   			                    // Hobbes specific config options, such as type of evaluation schema, type of tech stack etc., Have saved a default values for convenience
	├── .project			                    // This is automatically generated by eclipse, if this file is removed your eclipse will not recognize this as your eclipse project. 
	├── pom.xml 			                    // This is the parent POM, which holds Backend project and REST project dependencies.
	└── PROBLEM.md  		                    // This files describes the problem of the assignment/project, you can provide as much as information and clarification you want about the project in this file

> PS: All lint rule files are by default copied during the evaluation process, however if need to be customizing, you should copy from this repo and modify in your project repo


#### To use this as a boilerplate for your new project, you can follow these steps

1. Clone the base boilerplate in the folder **assignment-solution-step5** of your local machine
     
2. Navigate to assignment-solution-step5 folder

3. Remove its remote or original reference

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `assignment-solution-step5` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

5. Check the status of your repo 

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

7. Commit and Push the project to git

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
